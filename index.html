                <p>Jingliu was a swordmaster that was born in Xianzhou Cangcheng, 
                    which was one of Xianzhou fleets that had fallen from indirect 
                    influence of the Abundance. <span>Her swordplay was taught by her</span>
                     former master, who taught her the importance of taking matters into her own hands and not relying on ingenia (tech: aurumatons, etc.) to fight their battles. She was also a member of the once famous High Cloud Quintet. 
                     Her blade was crafted by Yingxing, another member of HCQ who was granted the title “Furnace Master” of the Artisanship Commission during their glorious days.l</p>
